# CodeMeta Generator

This repository contains a (client-side) web application to generate
CodeMeta documents (aka. `codemeta.json`).

The [CodeMeta initiative](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta)
is a Free and Open Source academic collaboration
creating a minimal metadata schema for research software and code.

The academic community recommends on adding a codemeta.json file in
the root directory of your repository.

With this linked data metadata file, you can easily declare the authorship,
include contextual information and link to other research outputs (publications,
data, etc.).

Also, the `codemeta.json` file in your source code is indexed in the
Software Heritage (SWH) archive, which will improve findability in searches.

## Specifications

### Use case

1. create a complete codemeta.json file from scratch
2. aggregate existing information and add complementary information to
   a codemeta.json file

### Functionalities

- helpers while completing the form, for example a reference list of SPDX
  licenses
- a validation mechanism after submission
- the possibility to use all the CodeMeta terms and Schema.org terms
- accessible from multiple platforms (web browsers or OS)
- (extra) the possibility to correct the output after validation as part
  of the creation process

This tool was initially prepared for the [FORCE19 Hackathon](https://github.com/force11/force11-rda-scidwg/tree/master/hackathon/FORCE2019).

**NB:** CodeMeta v2.0 is generated by default, but v3.0 (v2.0 compatible) can be generated via a dedicated button.

## Code contributions

This section only applies to developers who want to contribute to the CodeMeta Generator.
If you only want to use it, you can use
[the hosted version](https://codemeta.github.io/codemeta-generator/) instead.

### Code guidelines

This application is designed to work on popular modern browsers (Firefox,
Chromium/Google Chrome, Edge, Safari). Check [Caniuse](https://caniuse.com/)
for availability of features for these browsers.

To keep the architecture simple, we serve JavaScript files directly to
browsers, without a compiler or transpiler.

### Running local changes

To run CodeMeta Generator, you just need an HTTP server serving the
files (nginx, apache2, etc.).

The simplest way is probably to use Python's HTTP server:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta-generator
cd codemeta-generator
python3 -m http.server
```

then open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your web browser.

### Automatic testing

In addition to manual testing, we have automated tests to check for bugs
quickly, using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

To run them, first make sure you have npm and Cypress installed on your system.
From the project root, run:

```shell
sudo apt install npm  # or the equivalent on your system
npm run cypress:install
```

Then, run the tests:

```shell
npm test
```
